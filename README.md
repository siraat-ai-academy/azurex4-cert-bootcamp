## 🚀 A Soft Landing into the World of Azure Admin (AZ-104)

Once upon a whisper, Mr. **eks2** — the quiet echo from Naveed’s mind — looked up from beyond the galaxy and saw a glowing planet. Its name? **Azure.**

As he drew closer, he noticed light beams forming letters:  
**“AZ-104: Administrator Associate”** — a certification full of power, purpose, and potential.

And so he landed. Not with fear — but with calm in his heart, and spark in his eyes.*  
This repo is his trail. His map. His proof that **soft learners can do hard things** — especially when labs are filled with joy, clarity, and good company.
